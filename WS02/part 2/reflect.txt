During this workshop we visited new concepts like the move constructors 
and operators, the String library and the chrono library which allowed 
us to work with real time measurements.

In the first place, with the introduction of movement function we saw 
an import performance difference between the traditional copying and 
this method. This occurs because move is just transferring the data of 
objects instead of duplicating, the main example of this occurs when 
transferring the array instead of creating a new array and assigning 
each element the only thing changing is the ownership of the address.

With the introduction of string the management of these types becomes 
easier, even with this new approach we still needed to read the file 
two time one for sizing the array of strings and a second one for 
allocating it using temporary variables. To improve this we could 
implement the use of vectors which would allow for dynamic sizing.

Finally, with the introduction of the chrono library we found two 
different ways to refer to timestamps the steady_clock and system_clock. 
The main difference between this is two is their final purpose, 
system_clock is used to tell real time clock like calendar time. On 
the other hand steady_clock offers a really accurate measure of time 
which is why is used or time duration calculation thanks to its precision.
